                <h2>Chicken</h2>
                <p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of
                    raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent in
                    numerous cuisines.</p>

                    processed.</p>
